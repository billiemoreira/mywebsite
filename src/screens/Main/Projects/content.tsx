    The Epic Games Store is an electronic games distribution store for Microsoft
    Windows and macOS. The store is popular with gamers because it offers
    competitive prices and the fee paid to game developers is slightly higher
    than on platforms like Steam, Origin or GOG, for example. Despite being
    popular in this regard, many players who use Linux and do not use Windows
    and macOS, were unable to play the games, as the Epic Store does not support
    Linux. <p />
    To initially get around this problem, some Linux users were able to create
    an application that runs in text mode, called Legendary, which is an open
    source game launcher that runs games from the Epic Store, but which still
    limits some users because it is in beta mode and does not have a graphical
    mode for less experienced Linux users.

    I started the process of discovering UX with a question form of nine
    questions, some with open questions and others with multiple choice
    questions, the main target audience was novice or more experienced players
    who used Linux on the PC or laptop to play video games. This form was made
    available in two communities on the Reddit website, the Wine Gaming
    community and the GNU / Linux Gaming community. <p />
    Reddit, according to Wikipedia, is a social network in which users can post
    links to content on the Web such as links, posts and images, in which other
    users can then vote in a positive or negative way, in order to stand out on
    the main page.
    <p />
    My intention was to know the number of users who used Linux as the main game
    platform, which are the main Games Launchers they used when playing and what
    features they like, what they do not like in these applications and what
    they would like to add. <p />
    Questions were also asked to analyze which game styles are most popular with
    players and how they seek help when they have a problem with the game,
    platform, or application to run the game on Linux. In total 100 users
    responded, which was a limit given by the research platform I used,
    Typerform. Most likely I would get more answers, since the Linux community
    is very large and there are many players. But this is a great result of
    responses and I believe that I managed to reach a very large number of
    users.

    I noticed that users&apos; do not like open questions very much, as I got a
    Drop-off of 19% of users as soon as this type of question was shown. I found
    that users&apos; appreciate more multiple-choice questions that have
    less-than-great alternatives. It was not always possible to ask this type of
    multiple choice question, as I did not want to induce users answers or limit
    them in their opinions about a particular application. <p />
    Overall, users gave answers on how they wanted the platforms they already
    use to improve, and to add more functionality.
    <p />
    These answers were used to start the creation of the Game Launcher graphical
    mode, more focused initially on games from the Epic Game store, so not all
    users&apos; wishes can be fulfilled momentarily, because a good part of the
    users use more Steam since they already have a game launcher. The purpose of
    this research is to collect data so that the application grows and in the
    long run, can support User Interface Designer and developers when it gets
    bigger and start supporting more stores and more games.
